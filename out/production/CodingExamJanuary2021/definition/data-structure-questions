Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. We need data structure because we need a way to store and gather large amounts of data.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Data can be searched, inserted, deleted, sorted, merged.
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
what is an Array?
An array is a container that holds a fixed amount of values.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
You must specify the number of values stored in an array, while ArrayList's size may be altered.
what is LinkedList?
LinkedList is like an ArrayList, but instead of storing values into an index, the values are stored in a node, which carries both data as well as the next memory address.
How is an Array different from Linked List?
An array is a fixed amount of indexes which only contain data, while Linked list contains a node, which stores data as well as the next memory address of the next node.
what is queue?
Queue is first in, first out.
what is stack?
Stack is first in, last out.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO is first in, first out.
LIFO is last in, first out.
